## Hippocampal ripples and offline gains
Code and data for the paper "Hippocampal ripples predict motor learning during brief rest breaks in humans" now published in Nature Communications.

## Analyses
* Contrasts and simple correlations
* Linear mixed model w/interaction for gains ~ ripples: location
* Separate offline/online LMMs gains ~ ripples: location
* Plotting

A single script loads .csv files and computes the necessary statistics & plots the figures.

## Data cleaning and detection
* Filtering and artifact removal
* Ripple detection method using novel derivative discriminant classifier
* Plotting single- and multi-electrode ripples
